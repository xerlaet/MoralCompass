# Moral Compass

Our entry for the 2025 Hack Reason Competition: [Hack Reason 2025](https://hackreason2025.devpost.com/)

## Overview

This project utilizes s(CASP) for logical reasoning based on a utilitarian framework. It features a Pygame interactive environment where users respond to moral questions. Each decision is stored in `data.pl`, which is then analyzed by `core_logic.pl` to calculate the overall morality of the user's actions from a predefined utilitarian standpoint.

## Features

- **Interactive Environment**: Engage with a series of moral dilemmas presented in a Pygame interface.
- **Logical Reasoning**: Uses s(CASP) to evaluate the morality of decisions based on utilitarian principles.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback on the user's moral decisions and their impact.

## Usage

1. Run the Pygame environment:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to answer the moral questions.
3. The results will be calculated and displayed based on your decisions.

## Demonstration

This project demonstrates the potential of s(CASP) and logical reasoning in addressing various moral questions. It serves as a proof of concept for integrating logical reasoning frameworks with interactive environments.
